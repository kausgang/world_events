    "The remaining seven ships of the First Fleet, led by HMS&nbsp;<i>Sirius</i>, anchored in Botany Bay.\n",
    "Deciding that Botany Bay was unsuitable for settlement, Captain Arthur Phillip set out with a party in three open boats to seek out another site. He later reported to Lord Sydney, British Secretary of State; \"We got into Port Jackson early in the Afternoon, and had the satisfaction of finding the finest harbour in the world, in which a thousand Sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security.\" He selected a cove with a stream and named it Sydney Cove.\n",
    "The French ships <i>Boussole</i> and <i>Astrolabe</i> commanded by Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse appeared off Botany Bay.\n",
    "Captain Phillip sailed out of Botany Bay aboard the <i>Supply</i> and reached Sydney Cove in the evening.\n",

This day is now celebrated as Australia Day. In a ceremony at sunset Phillip and the officers drank to the health of the king and the royal family, and success to the new colony. In the meantime, La Perouse entered Botany Bay as the remaining British ships prepared to leave.\n",

    "Aboriginal peoples killed a convict and seriously injured another.\n",
    "The bodies of two rushcutters, William Okey and Samuel Davis, were found pierced with spears and beaten, evidently on reprisal for stealing a canoe belonging to Aboriginals. The next day Phillip led a party to apprehend the murderers, but he was unable to identify them.\n",
    "Owing to the neglect of the convict who was supposed to look after them, two bulls and four cows strayed from the settlement and were lost.\n",
    "In a despatch to the under-secretary of state, Evan Nepean, Phillip recorded the rations for marines and male convicts. For seven days each received 7 pounds of bread or in lieu thereof 7 pounds of flour, 7 pounds of beef or in lieu thereof pork, 3 pins of pease, 6 ounces of butter, 1 pound of flour or in lieu thereof 12 pounds of rice. The women received two-thirds of this amount and the children generally had one-third although some received as much as the women.\n",
